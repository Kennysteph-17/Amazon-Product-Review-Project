# Amazon-Product-Review-Project
This project entails data cleaning, data transformation, and analyzing a dataset of product listings and their associated customer reviews from the Amazon e-commerce platform. Using Microsoft Excel Power Query and Microsoft excel, the data was restructured to support effective insights using Pivot Tables and Dashboard Visualization.
## Objectives
The analysis answers the following key business questions:

1. What is the average discount percentage by product category?
2. How many products are listed under each category?
3. What is the total number of reviews per category?
4. Which products have the highest average ratings?
5. What is the average actual price vs. discounted price by category?
6. Which products have the highest number of reviews?
7. How many products have a discount of 50% or more?
8. What is the distribution of product ratings (e.g., how many products are rated 3.0, 4.0, etc.)?
9. What is the total potential revenue (actual_price × rating_count) by category?
10. What is the number of unique products per price range bucket (e.g., <$200, $200–$500, >$500)?
11. How does the rating relate to the level of discount?
12. How many products have fewer than 1,000 reviews?
13. Which categories have products with the highest discounts?
14. Identify the top 5 products in terms of rating and number of reviews combined.
